# Drought_Metrics  
This package produces metrics to evaluate models' performance on drought relative to observations.  
This package is also a demonstration of using the CMEC format.

## Environment  
If using conda, an environment can be created using drought_metrics.yml:  
`conda env create -f drought_metrics.yml`  
`conda activate drought_metrics`

## How to run this package  
Use git to clone this repository. There are two ways to run the evaluation.  

### Run from Drought_Metrics directory  
`cd` to the cloned Drought_Metrics directory. Use the command line to run drought_metrics.py:  
`python drought_metrics.py <-options>`  

To see all options (help):  
`python drought_metrics.py -h`  

### Run with CMEC driver (recommended)  
Follow the instructions here to install cmec-driver: https://github.com/cmecmetrics/cmec-driver  
From the cmec-driver directory:  
- Create the following directories: "obs", "model", and "output"  
- Copy your model data to model/Drought_Metrics  
- Copy your observations and shapefiles to obs/Drought_Metrics  
- `cd` to \<path to Drought Metrics\>. Change filenames and settings in cmec_drought_metrics.sh as needed.  
- `cd` back to cmec-driver. Run the following commands:  
`python src/cmec-driver.py register <path to Drought Metrics>`  
`python src/cmec-driver.py run -obs obs/Drought_Metrics model/Drought_Metrics output Drought_Metrics`  

Your results will be written to cmec-driver/output/Drought_Metrics. Open cmec-driver/output/Drought_Metrics/index.html with your browser to view the generated metrics files and plots.  

Results will be overwritten the next time cmec-driver is run with the same output path. To save results, either copy the output/Drought_Metrics folder to a new location or provide a unique output folder path when running cmec-driver.  

### Required flags
The following flags are always required to run the Drought Metrics package:
- test_path: Model data directory
- obs_path: Observation file path
- hu_name: Name of evaluation region
- shp_path: Watershed boundary file path

### Optional flags
Use these flags to specify additional files and settings:
- test_pr: model precipitation variable name (default "pr")
- obs_pr: observation precipitation variable name (default "pr")
- wgt_path: netcdf file with grid for interpolation (default '')
- out_path: output directory path (default '.')
- interpolation: True to interpolate inputs (default False)
- pfa: Path to existing principal metrics results (default None)

## Data  

### Observations  
This analysis was designed to use the CPC Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation over CONUS. This dataset is available from [NOAA PSL](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.unified.daily.conus.html). For best results, at least 50 years of data should be used.  

### Models
Monthly precipitation output should be in [CF-compliant](https://cfconventions.org/) netCDF files that conform to the standards for the CMIP6 project. Required dimensions are latitude, longitude, time, and precipitation flux "pr". The published analysis uses CMIP6 output.  

### Principal Metrics
The user has the option to reuse the results of a previous Principal Metrics analysis or to generate new principal metrics. 

To use the results of an old PFA analysis, set the optional `-pfa` flag to the path for those PFA results (by default named 'output_principal_metrics_column_defined').  
`python drought_metrics.py -pfa path/to/output_principal_metrics_column_defined`  
By default, cmec_drought_metrics.sh expects the principal metrics file to be placed in the Drought Metrics code folder. However, the user can overwrite this.

### Watershed Boundaries
This analysis requires a shapefile containing watershed boundaries. The boundary features must contain the fields "Name" and "geometry".  

The example boundaries provided in Drought_Metrics/HU are for watersheds in the US at the 2-digit level, based on data obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
